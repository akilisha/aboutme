> bangaizwa - state of being is a trance.

Why is it important to bring up this discussion? It's not a secret that colonization left Africans in a stunned state, with severe psychological and emotional scaring, completely unable to collectively recover, and due to this, there has never been a moment when Africans ever got tryly united. To further excercabate the fragmented state of African unity, there have always been concerted and relentless efforts behind the scenes by shadowy forces, even at the cost of human lives, to sabotage any work directed at building unity or consensus. Africans sometimes seem to get the sense that things are not right, yet their actions completely betray their utter inablilty to snap out of the trance they find themselve in.

For the enterity of the ensuing discussion, I will use 2nd person pronous like "we" and "our" in interject myself in the story, to speak about it from the perspective of an active participant, and not just an observer. And because Africa is a vast continent with different colonial powers grabbing whatever land they could, I will restrict my discussion to the British East African protectorate, and specifically the country of Kenya.

> Foreign cultures, foreign gods, foreign religions, foreign economic systems, foreign social norms, foreign diseases - all these came into direct conflict with Africa's traditional way of life, and they ended up completely upending what was previously the African way of understanding life and getting things done, and thus created a void in spiritual, intellectual and leadership matters and a general lack of consensue in the direction a community should move.

There are a few things that we can all probably agree upon without much debate, like the fact that our story as African has never quite been told in its enterity. We know very well about these two indisputable realities:

- that there are always two sides to any story.
- and that history is always written by the victors. 

This means that history, as experienced by the losing side, will more likely than not, never be told or become mainstream, but there is still a story to be told, with lessons to be learnt. The history books that Africans read about themselves were never written by Africans. They were written by the colonizers, from their own perspectives, which were not necessarily fair or accurate, and even perhaps were even designed to reinforce and perpetuate certain sterotypes. The result was that as Africans, when we read about our own history from these books, we are left with a hollow feeling that there are a lot of details left out or deliberately missing in the stories, but we have not mastered enough courage to challenge the conventional history that these books perpetrate, and so the existing sterotypes continue to be reinforced and define the African person.

This discussion is about shining a light to these topics in the hopes of generating conversations around them and encouraging further ressearch.
